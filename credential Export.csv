You will learn how to conduct Reliability & Maintainability (R&M) engineering planning activities across the acquisition lifecycle. Starting in the material solution analysis phase, students will develop R&M requirements. As systems mature through the acquisition process, students will develop R&M planning documents including reliability growth curves and other R&M planning products. In addition, this credential addresses R&M Engineering across the Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition Lifecycle and DoD's Digital Engineering fundamentals, strategic goals, and policies. Concepts explored include, but are not limited to, the process of providing R&M requirements and provisions in procurement requests, requests for proposals, contracts and exhibits. As systems mature through the acquisition process, students will develop R&M inputs to procurement documents and review the contractor's responses in proposals and negotiated contracts.

It is also essential for being an informed citizen. The history major covers an array of subjects: the Roman Empire, modern U.S. foreign policy, China's Cultural Revolution, medieval Islam, the American Revolution and many, many others. Every major takes an introductory seminar on historical writing and analysis, and the major concludes with a senior colloquium that allows students to conduct in-depth research on a topic of their choosing. History is a flexible major. That makes history an excellent choice for students who plan to study abroad or who want to complete a double major in another discipline.
 
 Students sometimes ask, â€úwhat can you do with a history major?â€  The answer is practically anything you want. History majors have attended some of the top graduate programs in the country. Many become teachers, but history majors also go into law, medicine and business, as well as careers in technology, international relations, politics and the media. Majoring in history prepares students well for the intellectual flexibility and ability to think outside the box that today's job market demands.

This program covers advanced ICD-9 medical coding procedures and will help you meet the challenge of today's changing standards while learning and improving your coding skills. When you've successfully completed this program, you'll: Understand how health information travels within departments of a facility. Be able to define the roles and responsibilities of a coder in both in- and out-patient facilities. Know how to interpret health-record documentation using your knowledge of anatomy, physiology, clinical disease processes, and medical terminology. Accurately assign codes for diagnoses, conditions, problems, or other reasons for patient encounters. Select codes according to Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Sets (UHDDS) definitions and official coding guidelines. Evaluate the effect of code selection on Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) assignment, and verify DRG assignment based on Prospective Payment System (PPS) definitions. Determine proper use of Modifiers, CPT vs. HCPCS Level II codes, and Medical Necessity (linking diagnosis to procedure or service). Understand reimbursement methodologies and documentation rules and regulations. Identify the Charge Master and its components. Understand the CPT guidelines, with special emphasis on Evaluation and Management (E &amp; M) and surgery coding. This program will help you become competent in these hospital-based coding areas: Data Identification; Read and interpret health-record documentation to identify diagnoses and procedures; Apply your knowledge of anatomy and physiology, clinical disease processes, pharmacology, and diagnostic and procedural terminology to assign accurate codes; Apply knowledge of disease processes and surgical procedures to assign non-indexed medical terms to the appropriate class; Coding Guidelines; Use current approved coding guidelines to assign and sequence the correct diagnosis and procedure codes for hospital inpatient services; Apply knowledge of CPT format, guidelines, and notes to locate the correct codes or correctly use an unlisted procedure code for a patient encounter, and sequence the codes correctly; Regulatory Guidelines: Apply UHDDS definitions to select accurate codes; Determine the appropriate principal diagnosis for patients who have more than one ailment; Use the Prospective Payment System to confirm a DRG assignment; Prevent fraud by maintaining approved coding principles and guidelines, including the National Correct Coding Initiative (CCI) Use the Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) Payment Groups to confirm ASC assignment and ensure appropriate reimbursement. Use the HCFA Common Procedural Coding System (HCPCS) to appropriately assign HCPCS codes for outpatient Medicare reimbursement. Coding: Understand which diagnoses, conditions, and procedures to exclude from codingApply your knowledge of ICD-9-CM instructional notations and conventions to locate, assign, and correctly sequence codes; Facilitate data retrieval by recognizing when more than one code is required to adequately classify a given condition. Data Quality: Clarify conflicting, ambiguous, or nonspecific information appearing in a health record by consulting the appropriate physician. Participate in quality assessment to ensure continuous improvement in ICD-9-CM and CPT coding and collection of accurate health data. Demonstrate ability to recognize potential coding-quality issues from an array of dataApply policies and procedures on health-record documentation and coding that are consistent with official coding guidelines. Contribute to the development of facility-specific coding policies and procedures. Facility coding (hospital coding) is one of the best-paying sectors of the coding profession. If you're already performing some aspect of facility coding, the Advanced Hospital Coding (AHC) Program will fill in the gaps, making you a more marketable employee. These skills are essential to your successful completion of the AHIMA mastery-level credentialing exam, the CCS. If you're currently working in a physician&rsquo;s office or billing service, this program will give you the edge you need to advance in the workplace. Most hospitals will only hire coders with previous exposure to facility coding or who are already certified. Training on-the-job is a luxury most hospitals are unable to offer. Coders of all levels must undergo continuing education to stay current with the constantly changing regulations. The AHC program covers advanced, hospital-specific coding and billing procedures and is designed to help students meet the challenge of today's changing standards. This program will utilize your existing knowledge of medical terminology and healthcare sciences.
