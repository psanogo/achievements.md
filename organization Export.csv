In 1966, the school changed its name to J. F. Drake State Technical Trade School in honor of the late Joseph Fanning Drake, long-time president of Alabama A&M University.  The Alabama State Board of Education granted Drake State technical college status in 1973 and adjusted its name to J. F. Drake State Technical College, allowing the school to offer the Associate in Applied Technology Degree (AAT). In January 2012, Drake State began its membership with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC).  This landmark achievement ensured transferability of general education courses and streamlined student transitions from two-year degrees into university programs anywhere in the United States - a tremendous enhancement for the school and its students. The final step in establishing the school's identity came in July of 2013 when the college officially became J.F. Drake State Community and Technical College.  Its name accurately depicts its standing as both a comprehensive community college and a core-driven technical college - the best of both worlds. With a strong and distinctive emphasis on hands-on learning, Drake State provides the benefit of combining traditional academics with increased lab study to deliver immediate functionality in the workplace.  Students also have the added advantage of opportunities in emerging research and entrepreneurial pursuits with training not typically offered at other two-year institutions - all creating a unique atmosphere for practical job preparation. J.F.

UNG's emphasis on leadership, innovation, collaboration, and exploration unleashes students' potential to make a meaningful impact in the workforce and in the communities they serve.
 
 UNG strives to develop students into leaders for a diverse and global society by providing a culture of academic excellence in a student-focused environment that includes quality education, service, inquiry and creativity. As a result, UNG has produced generations of military, professional and civic leaders who serve in Georgia and throughout the world.
 
 UNG is one of only six federally-designated senior military colleges in the nation, and its Dahlonega Campus hosts an all-Army ROTC Corps of Cadets of more than 750 students. This distinctive part of UNG's mission and identity have garnered the university designations as a State Leadership Institution and The Military College of Georgia. In 2017 and 2019, UNG's Corps of Cadets earned the Gen. Douglas MacArthur Award and claimed the honors as the top Army ROTC program among the nation's senior military colleges, which include The Citadel, Norwich University, Texas A&M, Virginia Tech, and VMI. Nearly half of all officers in the Georgia Army National Guard have commissioned through UNG.
 
 To support the development of globally-prepared leaders, UNG offers 12 language programs and is designated a Chinese Language Flagship by the National Security Education Program and the U.S. Department of Defense. Additionally, UNG is a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education and won the 2019 National Security Agency Codebreaker Challenge among a field of 500 competing institutions.
 
 UNG continues to expand its national reputation, earning high marks in rankings for value and affordability, innovation, and academic excellence. Since 2013, UNG students have earned nearly $2 million in prestigious nationally competitive scholarship programs, such as the Barry Goldwater Scholarship, the Harry S. Truman Scholarship, and the National Institutes of Health Undergraduate Scholarships. UNG was recognized nationally as a top producer of Fulbright Student Scholars in 2017, 2018, and 2019 and was the only university in Georgia to earn this designation in 2019.
 
 UNG was the first public university in Georgia to earn the prestigious Carnegie Community Engagement classification. Through its academic programs and institutes, UNG provides faculty and students with opportunities to gain relevant, hands-on experience in their fields of study in ways that also benefit local communities in the region.
